**Crypter** is a simple, convenient and secure encryption client.
It simplifies password generation by deriving it using your MasterPassKey (see Crypto).

This is based on [Crypto.Sync](https://github.com/HR/CryptoSync) (an end-to-end
cloud encryption client) which is a more elaborate implementation of the idea.
So check it out as well!

## Status
The decryption functionality is being implemented for the next major release
[v2.0](https://github.com/HR/Crypter/milestones/v2.0) in the "dev" branch. Feel
free to send PRs to speed this up! 

For the first release [v1.0](https://github.com/HR/Crypter/releases/tag/v1.0)
(on master branch), all of the UI and the encryption functionality has been
implemented.  All internal modules are fully tested (100% coverage). Some
end-to-end tests have been written (see test/ui/test.js) but end-to-end testing
is still mostly a WIP.

If you have any suggestions then please open an issue!

## Crypto
> One key to to derive them all!

Crypter uses a MasterPass (obtained at setup) to derive a MasterPassKey using
the PBKDF2 key derivation algorithm from the MasterPass (see below for spec). It
then derives very secure encryption keys that are used for the encryption of
files from the MasterPassKey using the PBKDF2 key derivation algorithm again.
This method allows for the generation of very secure encryption keys for data
encryption. Moreover, by just publicly storing the credentials used to
derive the MasterPassKey and the salts used to derive the encryption keys you
have the flexibility of deriving the encryption keys whenever you need to and
not having to worry about storing them securely. All you have to do is remember
your MasterPass.


Authentication is used by default since the AES-256-GCM symmetric block cipher
is used.

```
// Crypto defaults
let defaults = {
  iterations: 50000, // file encryption key derivation iterations
  keyLength: 32, // encryption key length
  ivLength: 12, // initialisation vector length
  algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm', // encryption algorithm
  digest: 'sha256', // PBKDF2 hash function
  hash_alg: 'sha256', // default hashing function
  mpk_iterations: 100000 // MasterPassKey derivation iterations
}
```

## Security
Crypter uses a WeakMap to store the MasterPassKey inside the MasterPassKey class
using closure function. This makes the MasterPassKey data held in the object
(externally) inaccessible to an extent which increases the protection of the
MasterPassKey. The MasterPassKey is never flushed to the filesystem and always
kept in (main) memory. Since JS does not give control over or allow such a
low-level operation as wiping memory, the program relies on the garbage
collection and volatility of the main memory for the permanent erasure of the
MasterPassKey stored in memory.

A decent number of iterations (see above specs) are used for the derivation of
the MasterPassKey to mitigate brute-force attacks. A good amount of iterations
are used for the derivation of the encryption keys from the MasterPasKey this is
so that performance and speed is not significantly compromised. For critical
application, you may choose to select 10,000,000 iterations instead (in
src/crypto.js). Refer to

more info

## Dev
The "dev" branch is the development branch and may be unstable. However the
"master" branch is will always be kept stable.
### Install (dependencies)
To install all dependencies run
```
$ npm install
```

### Run
Uses gulp for a few things (so install gulp it globally if haven't already) and
so to start the app simply run
```
$ gulp
```
### Test
Uses mainly mocha (+ chai) for testing. Since the project uses a lot of JS ES6
syntax, babel is used as a compiler. To run all the tests
```
$ npm test
```
Uses istanbul for coverage. To run test coverage
```
$ gulp coverage
```

### Build
To build the app for your OSX (darwin)
```
$ npm run xbuild
```
To build the app for your Windows x84 and x64 (win32) run the win-build script
```
$ ./script/win-build.sh
```
Since it is an Electron app, it can be built for OS X, Linux, and Windows but
has currently only been tested on OSX.
