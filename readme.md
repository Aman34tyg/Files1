# Crypter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HR/Crypter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HR/Crypter) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/HR/Crypter/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/HR/Crypter?branch=master) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/HR/Crypter/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/HR/Crypter) [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)

Crypter is a simple, convenient and secure encryption client.  
Simplifies password generation by deriving it using your MasterPassKey
(see Crypto).
Since it is an Electron app so it is cross-platform but has currently only been
tested on OSX.

## Status
All of the UI and functionality has been implemented but tests are still being.

## Crypto
> One key to to derive them all!

Crypter uses a MasterPass (obtained at setup) to derive a MasterPassKey using the
PBKDF2 key derivation algorithm from the MasterPass (see below for spec). It
then derives unique encryption keys for every file to be encrypted from the
MasterPassKey. This method allows for the generation of very secure encryption
keys than can be derived again using the

```
// Crypto defaults
let defaults = {
  iterations: 50000, // file encryption key derivation iterations
  keyLength: 32, // encryption key length
  ivLength: 12, // initialisation vector length
  algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm', // encryption algorithm
  digest: 'sha256', // PBKDF2 hash function
  hash_alg: 'sha256', // default hashing function
  mpk_iterations: 100000 // MasterPassKey derivation iterations
}
```

## Dev

### Install (dependencies)
```
$ npm install
```

### Run
Uses gulp for a lot of things so if you have not already, then install gulp
globally
```
$ gulp
```

### Build
To build the app (compile into executable) for your platform
```
$ npm run build
```

Builds the app for OS X, Linux *, and Windows *.
